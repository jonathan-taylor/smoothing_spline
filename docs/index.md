# Smoothing Spline Documentation

This repository provides a minimal implementation of a smoothing spline, similar to `smooth.spline` in R.

It is implemented in C++ with python bindings provided by `pybind11`.

See the table of contents for more details on the theory and comparisons with other implementations.
